# InputCJK_Extension
日本語は下の方を見てね。
This is an extension for GDevelop that allows you to input multi-byte characters (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc.).

Notes.
- Cannot be used in conjunction with text input objects.
- It can be used in mobile apps, but there is a slight problem.
- It is practical, but there is room for improvement.
